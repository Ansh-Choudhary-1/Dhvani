<h1>Federated Learning on Blockchain Platform with Explainable AI (XAI)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This platform combines Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Explainable AI (XAI) to revolutionize the way AI models are developed, trained, and deployed. It focuses on ensuring data privacy, security, scalability, and regulatory compliance while fostering international cooperation for AI model development. The platform enables collaborative, decentralized AI model training without requiring sensitive data to leave its local environment. Blockchain technology ensures that model updates are immutable, transparent, and auditable, while XAI provides understandable and trustworthy justifications for AI decisions.</p>
