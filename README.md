#DHVANI
<p>By bridging the gap between local Indian merchants and foreign customers, our goal is to create DHVANI, a globalization platform for farmers, craftsmen, and any local sellers looking to expand globally. For Indian SMBs, particularly artisans, farmers, and local vendors, Dhvani is an integrated digital platform that streamlines the export process. It removes frequent obstacles to global trade by streamlining certification, documentation, lab access, and market entry.</p><br>

<p>The Name-<b> DHVANI </b>– resembles the flow and voices that travel across borders carrying our traditions worldwide- and creating a sense of shared cultures and unity.</p>
